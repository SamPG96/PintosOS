Pintos OS was developed at Stanford University to enable students to experience many of the
features of a real OS, without some of the complexities of an operating system such as Linux
or MS Windows.

As part of one of my second year undergraduate assignments, in groups we had to develop system calls
for the Pintos Operating System, as well as implementing support for argument passing.
i.e. passing arguments into a user process in Pintos.

These are the systems call that have been successfully implemnted:
 - halt
 - exec
 - create
 - remove
 - open
 - filesize
 - read
 - write
 - seek
 - tell
 - close
 
 Our group:
  - Samuel Gasper
  - Conor Newcombe
  - Jacob Creed
  
 We where already given a big chunk of the OS by our lecturer so that we could implement argument
 passing and system calls.
  
 NOTE: This assignment was completed as a group, so there was collaboration on a number of commits.
